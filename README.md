# vibe

One command to set up Claude Code with skills, agents, and MCPs — learned from how you actually code.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intern-c-ag/vibe/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/my-project
vibe
```

That's it. Vibe scans your project, generates a `.claude/` folder with agents, skills, commands, and config tailored to your stack, discovers and installs relevant MCP servers, installs Claude Code if needed, and launches it.

### Train on your repos

The real power: teach vibe how *you* code, then carry that everywhere.

```bash
# Learn from your existing projects
vibe train ~/projects/solana-app ~/projects/api-server

# Now every project gets your patterns
cd ~/new-project && vibe
```

Training is AI-first by default with cache protection: it scans your code (skips secrets), applies context directives, and uses Claude when needed. Cache hits skip unnecessary AI calls.

`vibe train` also uses partial cache reuse by default:

```bash
# 1) First run (no cache yet): full generation for every repo
vibe train ~/projects/app ~/projects/api

# 2) Run again with no changes: full cache hit (no regeneration)
vibe train ~/projects/app ~/projects/api

# 3) Change only one repo: partial regeneration (only changed repo regenerates)
vibe train ~/projects/app ~/projects/api
```

Use `--force-retrain` to bypass cache and regenerate everything.

You can also add extra context files (docs or Opencode/Claude markdown exports):

```bash
vibe train . \
  --context ~/exports/claude-session.md \
  --context ~/docs/roadmap.md
```

Session-style markdown exports are parsed for structured signals (decisions, conventions, architecture notes, security requirements, TODOs, tooling/workflow) with **confidence-weighted scoring**:

- **High confidence**: Explicit constraints ("only Solana+Zcash", "must use", "never do X"), security requirements, and heading-matched decisions are prioritized and injected as critical directives that override repo scan inferences.
- **Medium confidence**: Architectural decisions, coding conventions extracted from context.
- **Low confidence**: Vague or short items that provide background but don't drive skill generation.

This ensures context files from exported conversations (Claude Code, Opencode) strongly influence generated skills rather than being diluted by repo scan noise. A summary of applied directives is logged during training.

Plain markdown gracefully falls back to raw excerpt context.

### All commands

```
vibe                     Set up project + launch Claude Code
vibe train <path...>     Learn patterns from your repos (AI-first with cache reuse)
vibe init                Set up project without launching
vibe mcp                 Discover and install MCP servers
vibe push [repo]         Push skill library to GitHub
vibe list                List trained skills
vibe config [key] [val]  Get or set configuration
```

### Flags

```
--context <file>     Add extra context file (repeatable)
--force-retrain      Ignore cache and force skill regeneration (train only)
--force              Overwrite existing files
--new                Fresh session (skip resume)
--no-claude          Skip Claude Code install/launch
```

## What gets generated

```
.claude/
├── agents/          Specialized sub-agents (research, commits, testing, review)
│                    + domain agents auto-detected (Solana, Zcash, Circom, mobile)
├── skills/          Auto-generated + trained skills for your stack
├── commands/        Slash commands (/commit, /review, /test, /fix)
├── config/          Project configuration
└── settings.json
```

Everything is generated dynamically based on your actual project — not from a static template.

### Domain Agents

When domain-specific signals are detected in your project stack, additional specialized agents are auto-generated:

| Domain | Agent | Triggered by |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Solana | `solana-security-reviewer` | Anchor, SPL, Solana frameworks |
| Zcash | `zcash-wallet-specialist` | librustzcash, zebra, sapling/orchard |
| Circom/ZK | `zk-circom-engineer` | Circom, snarkjs, ZK proof tooling |
| Mobile Wallet | `mobile-wallet-performance` | React Native/Flutter + crypto signals |

Domain agents are preserved across re-runs unless `--force` is used.

## Identity Override (`vibe-identity.md`)

If your project's inferred identity drifts (e.g., vibe says "multi-chain" when you mean "Solana + Zcash only"), create a `vibe-identity.md` at the repo root. It takes **highest precedence** over README and manifest inference.

**Precedence order:**
1. `vibe-identity.md` (pinned identity — never overridden)
2. Context files (`IDENTITY.md`, `.vibe/identity.md`)
3. README / manifest inference
4. Fallback (project name)

**Example `vibe-identity.md`:**

```markdown
# MyWallet

A privacy-focused Solana + Zcash wallet for mobile.

- Chains: Solana, Zcash — no others.
- Target: iOS and Android via React Native.
- Tone: security-first, minimalist.
```

The log output will show `identity source: vibe-identity.md` so you can verify which source was used.
